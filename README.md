Hi All,
This is a personal Mapping Project showing all cultural spaces in Vancouver, BC Canada.

The mapping application is hosted here: <https://sarang.shinyapps.io/vanmap>

The data is available here: http://vancouver.ca/your-government/cultural-spaces-open-dataset.aspx

This is how it looks like! More maps to follow soon.
